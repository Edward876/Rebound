### Injury Detection 
#### Knee OsteoOrthoritis

1. Dataset & Preprocessing

- The dataset consists of labeled knee X-ray images categorized into different severity levels:

  - Healthy

  - Doubtful

  - Minimal

  - Moderate

  - Severe

- Classes like Minimal and Doubtful were removed to focus on clearer classification.

- The dataset was preprocessed by normalizing pixel values and augmenting images to balance class distribution.

2. Deep Learning Model

- Base Model: EfficientNetB5, pretrained on ImageNet, used for feature extraction.

- Custom Layers:

  - Batch Normalization for stabilization.

  - Fully Connected Layers with dropout to prevent overfitting.

  - Softmax Output Layer for multi-class classification.

  - Optimizer: Adamax, with a learning rate of 0.001.

  - Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy.

3. Training & Validation

- Data Augmentation (rotation, flipping, and zooming) was applied to increase dataset diversity.

- The model was trained for 40 epochs, achieving high accuracy.

- The validation dataset ensured proper generalization before testing.

4. Evaluation & Performance

- The model was tested on an unseen dataset, achieving a test accuracy of 95.84%.

- Performance was evaluated using a confusion matrix and classification report.

5. Model Deployment & Future Scope

- The trained model (best_knee_effnetb5.keras) can be integrated into medical diagnostic applications.
- Deployed in HuggingFace with Gradio Interface [Knee Model Link](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Shinichi876/knee_osteoarthritis/tree/main)

### FITNESS CHATBOT USING PATHWAYS AND GROQ

## Key Technologies  

### **1. Pathway (PW.io) for Efficient Data Processing**  
**Pathway** is used for handling real-time data processing. It enables seamless integration with structured data formats like CSV and ensures efficient **schema-based data loading**.  
- **Schema Definition**: Pathway enforces a structured schema (`FitnessSchema`) for processing fitness-related Q&A pairs.  
- **CSV Parsing & Processing**: The chatbot loads `Fitness_Guide_Dataset.csv` in **static mode**, converting it into a **Pathway table** and then into a Pandas DataFrame for further processing.  

> üöÄ Pathway is excellent for streaming data pipelines and real-time processing, but here, it is used in a static mode to load structured fitness Q&A data.  

### **2. Groq API for AI-Powered Responses**  
**Groq** is an advanced AI-powered API optimized for **low-latency, high-performance large language models (LLMs)**. In this chatbot, Groq is responsible for **enhancing responses** retrieved from the dataset by:  
- **Understanding Context**: The model generates responses in a conversational manner while ensuring domain-specific accuracy.  
- **Fine-Tuned Creativity**: A **temperature setting of 0.7** ensures that responses are **varied and engaging**.  
- **Limiting Scope**: The chatbot restricts discussions to fitness and healthcare, preventing it from responding to **irrelevant queries**.  

The **Groq AI API call** works as follows:  
1. The **retrieved answer** from the dataset is **fed into Groq's API**.  
2. A **structured system prompt** ensures the AI-generated response remains **on-topic and engaging**.  
3. The model **mixtral-8x7b-32768** is used for generating responses with a token limit of **2000**.  

> üèãÔ∏è **Groq is ideal for performance-driven AI applications**, ensuring **fast and high-quality** responses.  

## Workflow of the Chatbot  
1. **User Inputs Query**: The chatbot takes a **fitness or nutrition-related question** as input.  
2. **Pathway Retrieves Best-Matching Answer**:  
   - The chatbot uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity** to find the **closest matching question** from the dataset.  
3. **Groq API Enhances the Response**:  
   - The best-matching answer is fed into **Groq's LLM**, which **refines, enhances, and personalizes** the response.  
4. **User Receives a Comprehensive Answer**:  
   - The chatbot returns the **Groq-enhanced** response in a conversational style.  

## **Deployment with Gradio**  
To make the chatbot **user-friendly**, **Gradio** provides an **interactive interface**, allowing users to ask fitness-related questions.  
- **Input**: Textbox for user queries.  
- **Output**: AI-generated response.  
- **Title & Description**: Clearly states the chatbot's purpose and functionalities.  
- **Web Interface**: The chatbot runs **locally or on the web** with `interface.launch()`.  

## **Advantages of Using Pathway & Groq**  
‚úÖ **Fast Data Retrieval**: Pathway allows structured retrieval, ensuring **efficient Q&A matching**.  
‚úÖ **High-Performance AI Responses**: Groq‚Äôs optimized LLM **enhances responses** dynamically.  
‚úÖ **Scalability**: The system can **scale** by expanding datasets or integrating **real-time updates**.  
‚úÖ **Domain-Specific Intelligence**: Ensures **context-aware** and **relevant** fitness-related answers.
